# DNS Blocklists for Lockdown Environments
### Block access to Internet distractions, and get the task done

Support for IPv4 and IPv6

## Available Blocklists
1. Invidious
2. DNS Providers (Mullvad)
3. Search Engines
4. Tor Browser (and other Tor-related Projects)

Criteria for adding search engine:
1. url: the link to it
2. child_safe: Is SafeSearch strictly enforced (and can't be changed at all)
3. has_graphics: Does it deliver graphical content (images, videos, or GIF's)
4. damaging_if_disabled: Does blocking it affect other websites (e.g., blocking google.com makes using youtube, maps, or recaptchas difficult to access) (It should break at least 2 websites)? Or is it a very crucial resource (e.g., Wikipedia) that there are no alternatives to it when blocked?
